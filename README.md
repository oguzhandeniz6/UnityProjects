Pixelatformer

It is a metroidvania type platformer game that I made by blending all the tools of Unity. 
I used animations, audios, prefabs, materials, TileMap, UI, Scene Management, Unity's new input system and Cinemachine camera. 
There are mechanics such as moving enemies, life and score indicators, shooting and changing levels in the game.

Save the I.S.S.

Space themed platformer game that I made for HUJAM'22 in 72 hours. 
I couldn't complete the game because I was alone and in a busy period. 
I designed Portal and Gravity Boots mechanics.

A 2D Top Down action game with the theme of Academy Adventures. We made this game at Google Game and App Academy Gamejam in 48 hours.
